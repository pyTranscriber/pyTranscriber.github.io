<b>17/08/2022 - v1.8 </b>
<br>1. Fixed bug: language codes for Chinese Languages updated accordingly to Speech API. Changed to "cmn-Hans-CN" and "cmn-Hant-TW" instead of "zh / zh-TW").. The output was always mistakenly coming in Cantonese (yue-Hant-HK). Now they come properly in Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese. Thanks to "Specter Hi" for reporting!
<br>2. Added GUI language switch feature
<br>3. Updated link to funding campaign at GitHub Sponsors
